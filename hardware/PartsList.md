The unit costs of some materials change when purchased in bulk (e.g. resistors and diodes), and others have minimum quantities that will make multiple sensors (e.g. epoxy, solder, PVC pipe). These unit costs were calculated based on purchasing materials for 50 sensors. The cost to build 1 sensor with no starting equipment will be much higher.
